* Limit fraction precision
* Do not recalculate plot data when it has not changed
* Instant apply for all parameters in plot
* Plot-functions
* Sexagesimal numbers
* Permutations
* Matrix area
* Finish differentiation
* Fix dates
* Check if unit is used on delete

* Complex numbers
* Sort out percentile and provide alternative methods
* Ask for exchange rate update on demand

* Sort out cases where we should not do anything because x is unknown, 
  such as sqrt(-5x) which now returns sqrt(-5) * sqrt(x)
* Get rid of wget dependency
* Split up interface code
* Move unknown over to the other side in unsolved comparison
* Sort out x^-y -- (1/3)/(x+y)=1/3(x+y) but 1/3(x+y)=1/(3x+3y)
